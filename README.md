# PS-Profile
this is my powershell settings where I tried to make the linux command functionality a few commands that you might want to use
## How to install
1. Clone repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrDarkGoose/PS-Profile.git
```
2. Copy and past to the folder ```C:\Users\white\Documents\WindowsPowerShell```
   - If you don't have a folder, create one.
     ```bash
     mkdir C:\Users\white\Documents\WindowsPowerShell
     ```
