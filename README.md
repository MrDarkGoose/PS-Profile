# PS-Profile
this is my powershell settings where I tried to make the linux command functionality a few commands that you might want to use

## What it is doing

1. Command from linux
   - `reboot` - reboot the system
   - `poweroff` - turns off the system
   - `pkill` - kills the process
   - `grep` - shows a line with the word you specify in the file or in the command output.
   - `wc` - shows information about the file how many words how many lines and how many bytes it occupies
   - `uname` - show a summary of the system
   - `ls` - navigates files from the folder where the user is located (this command is also available in regular powershell, but I made it more similar to the linux version).
   - `mkdir` - creates a folder (it is in powershell natively, but I made a similar one for the linux version).
   - `pwd` - to show which package the user is in (it is in powershell in native, but I made it look like the linux version).
2. Custom command
   - `history` - shows the entire history of the teams over time
   - `reload-explorer` - restarts explorer or starts it if it is not running
   - `toggle-errmsg` - and initially in the config it is written that there is no error output, but with this command you can enable or disable the output.
   - `cum` - **CUM - Clear Used Memory**,this command clears RAM
   - `bsod` - âš  This command requires administrator rights.

## How to use
   - ### `pkill`
   ```powershell
   pkill "program names"
   ```
   - ### `grep`
   ```powershell
   grep "word" "namefile"
   ```
or
   ```powershell
   command | grep "word"
   ```
   - ### `ls`
     - `-a` - shows all files even if they are hidden.
     - `-r` - shows files in folders from the folder where the user is located.
     - `-d` - shows only folders.
   ```powershell
   ls parameter
   ```
   or
   ```powershell
   ls paramter path
   ```

## How to install
1. Clone repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrDarkGoose/PS-Profile.git
```
2. Copy and past to the folder ```C:\Users\%username%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell```
  - If you don't have a folder, create one.

```bash
mkdir C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell
```
